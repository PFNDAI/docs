# Getting Started

To begin your exoplanet discovery journey, ensure your system runs Python 3.8 or higher with libraries like NumPy, pandas, and TensorFlow. 
Start by cloning the project from its GitHub repository at https://github.com/pathfinder-agent/pathfinder, then set up the environment with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch the tool using:

```bash
python pathfinder.py --input tess_data.csv
```

Explore the `output/` folder for results, including plots that highlight new findings.
