# Key Features

- Detects exoplanets by spotting periodic dips in star brightness using the transit method.
- Constructs light curves by summing pixel brightness from TESS star videos and plotting trends over time.
- Applies Fourier transform analysis to confirm recurring signals indicative of planetary orbits.
- Produces user-friendly visualizations, including light curves and folded plots, for clear interpretation.
- Enables real-time processing of TESS Target Pixel Files with efficient data handling.
