# How It Works

The process starts with PATHFINDER AI processing TESS video data, where each frameâ€™s pixels capture starlight as luminosity through photon counts. 
These counts are summed to form a brightness value per moment, creating a light curve that tracks changes over time and reveals dips suggesting planetary transits. 
Validation follows with Fourier transform analysis to detect recurring patterns, such as a 3.5-day dip, overlaid on the original data to confirm an exoplanet when the alignment is exact.
